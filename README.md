## Program Name _BEEP BOOP_ 3rd Independent Project

## Description

This webpage is an exercise to test my understanding and skills with arrays and looping in JavaScript. With my growing skills in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Jquery to make the webpage functional and aesthetic to the user, the theme is based on a fictional robot that outputs a response based on the number inputted on the form. The user enters any whole, positive number and the output is every number starting from 0 up to that number. Any number containing a 3, 2, or 1 is returned with a "Sorry Dave(or user name), I'm afraid I can't do that.", "Boop", or "Beep", respectively.

### Specs

| Spec | Input | Output |
| :-----------------    | :------------------ | :-------------- |
| **Returns a range of numbers from 0 to the users inputted number.** |  *_Input:_ "4" | *_Output:_ "0, 1, 2, 3, 4" |
| **Returns "Beep!" for every number in the range containing the digit "1" | *_Input:_ "1" |*_Output:_ "0, Beep!" |
| **Returns "Boop!" for every number in the range containing the digit "2" |*_Input:_ "2" | *_Output:_ "0, Beep!, Boop!" |
| **Returns "I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that" for every number in the range containing the digit "3" | *_Input:_ "3" | *_Output:_ "0, Beep!, Boop!, I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that" |
| **If a number contains a combination of "1","2",and/or "3", the program takes precedence over "3" first, then "2". | *_Input:_ "15" | *_Output:_ "0, Beep!, Boop!, I'm sorry ..., 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, Beep!, Boop!, I'm sorry Dave..., Beep!, Beep!" |
